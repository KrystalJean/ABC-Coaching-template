  This repo is for beginners only who want to participate in Hacktoberfest, and become more comfortable using git, and GitHub.  I am also a beginner, and have been having a hard time finding Issues for me to practice with since I only know HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript at this point.  I hope this will help some beginners, like me to gain some confidence, and get some hands on experience.

  This is a pretty basic landing page for a gym.  I changed the info to be generic information, so this is basically a template for a Gym or business that someone could use, and insert their own information.  I do want to keep the layout and color scheme pretty similar, but will create some issues for a few things I noticed like responsiveness, adding a footer with social icons or contact me form, making the buttons more exciting when you hover over them.  You are welcome to suggest other issues, and I will do my best to keep up, and respond ASAP.
